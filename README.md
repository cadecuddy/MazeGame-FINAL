Collaborative network Maze Game

Our software is a web-based collaborative maze game where many players are able to connect over a network and “vote” on a sprite’s path through a randomly generated maze. The users will have 4 directions to vote from every 10-15 seconds in order to complete the maze and will have to work together to vote on the correct directions. The main player sprite can only see spaces in the maze that are touching it in the four cardinal directions and diagonally from a distance of 1 space. The highest percentage voted direction will be the direction the sprite moves. The software will mainly be a server-side application that is run on a host computer which will act as a server in which other people connect to through a web browser.

A "Twitch Plays Pokemon" esque game.
